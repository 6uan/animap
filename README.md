## Notes

Being able to separate each location while keeping all my data in the same table was a bit tricky, but overall, it was a cool project! I picked Central Park Zoo due to its size and the fact that I visited New York, but unfortunately, I didn't visit the Zoo. :(. P.S. The Map render came from MapBox. I would've loved to implement their dynamic 3D map, but I don't think I would have enough time to finish.
